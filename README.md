Lean Manufacturing

This program simulates the flow of items on a production line with stages that add and don't add value. The simulation uses resources (to represent machines/stations) and includes a quality check with the possibility of rework. At the end, the total times and efficiency (ratio between time for value-adding activities and total process time) are calculated.
